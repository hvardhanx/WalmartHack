# WalmartHack

We aim to create a platform for the healthcare of patients. Users can discuss about their diseases with other patients with similar symptoms and with doctors with specialization in that particular disease on our platform, check nearby stores for medicines, check nearby emergencies and help other patients if they are nearby the patients, because it isn't always possible for the doctor to be around. Helps user to earn money for charity while they run, walk or bike. Users can also upload prescriptions for future reference and for helping other people with similar symptoms.
